# Thesis Project: Mental Health Stigma and Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes 

This repository is part of my master thesis exploring mental health stigma and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes.

##🧠 Project Overview
This thesis systematically maps out the existing research on how different types of mental health stigma — self, public, and structural — are associated with CVD-related outcomes.

##📁 Repository Structure

- `/data` - Raw and cleaned datasets used for analysis
- `/scripts` – R scripts for data cleaning, deduplication, visualization, and matrix generation
- `/figures` – final figures used in the thesis (heatmaps, maps, bar charts, etc.)
- `/docs` – Final thesis manuscript (PDF)
- `README.md` – Project Overview (this file)
- `LICENSE` – MIT License (or another, if updated)

## 📊 Reproduce the Analysis

1. Open `scripts/01_cleaning_deduplicates_maps_charts.Rmd` in RStudio  
2. Run or knit the file to regenerate:
   - Bar chart: Number of studies per year  
   - Map: Geographic distribution of studies  
   - Heatmap: Stigma type × CVD outcome matrix  
3. Output images will be saved to the `figures/` folder

All required R packages are listed at the top of the script. Run `install.packages()` if needed.
